# Qwen2-VL Ollama API Emulator for models not yet supported

This project partialy replicates Ollama API endpoints for `Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct` and can easily be adapted to other models that are not yet supported by official Ollama. It uses the `Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct` model from Hugging Face and provides endpoints for text generation and chat functionality similar to Ollama's API to be used with the official Ollama python client library.

- **Streaming** or non-streaming responses.
- Customizable prompts, generation options, and **system messages**.

## Requirements

- Linux or WSL for flash attention 2
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch with CUDA (optional for GPU acceleration)
- [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- FastAPI and Uvicorn for the web framework

## Installation

1. ##### Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qwen2vl-ollama-api.git
   cd qwen2vl-ollama-api
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   python -m pip install -U pip
   ```

2. ##### Install dependencies:

   **PyTorch** is required for GPU support.
   Please refer to [Installing PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for more details.

   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   Requirements include:
   - FastAPI
   - Uvicorn
   - Hugging Face Transformers
   - Torch
   - Pillow
   - Requests
   - Pydantic

3. ##### Ensure you have the `Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct` model downloaded:

   ```bash
   transformers-cli download Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct
   ```

## Running the Server

To start the FastAPI server locally, run the following command:

```bash
python .\api.py --host=0.0.0.0 --port=11435
```

The server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:11435`.

## API Endpoints

### `/api/generate`

Generates text based on a given prompt and optional images.

#### Request:

```json
POST /api/generate
{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct",
    "prompt": "Explain quantum physics in simple terms.",
    "options": {
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "max_tokens": 100
    },
    "stream": true,
    "format": "json",  # Use this to get output in valid JSON format
    "images": ["base64_image_data_or_url"],
    "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant."
}
```

#### Response:

- **Streaming**: JSONL responses with `done: false` and a final message with `done: true`.
- **Non-streaming**: JSON object with the complete response.

### `/api/chat`

Supports multi-turn conversations with optional images.

#### Request:

```json
POST /api/chat
{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Tell me a joke."
        }
    ],
    "options": {
        "temperature": 0.8
    },
    "stream": true
}
```

#### Response:

Similar to `/api/generate`, supports streaming or non-streaming JSON responses.

### `/api/models`

Lists all available models endpoint for compatibility.

#### Response:

```json
{
    "models": ["Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct"]
}
```

## Configuration

- **Model and Device:** The model is loaded using the `Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct` transformer, and it automatically selects GPU if available. Around 17GB of VRAM is required for the 7B model.
- **Streaming:** You can enable or disable streaming via the `stream` parameter in the API requests.
- **Images:** Supports base64-encoded images, file paths, and URLs.
- **JSON Format:** The `format="json"` option ensures the output is formatted in valid JSON, which is useful for structured data processing.
